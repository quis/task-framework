# e-RS Task Framework 
> Base utility module for building a task scheduling function

## Background & Goals

The goal of this software is to provide a generic base from which specific task frameworks may be derived.
Software concepts relevent to the software include;

* Tasks
* States
* Queues

The common framework orchestrates each Task's lifecycle through mulitple "states" using a series of state-based queues.  (These queues are currently persisted in an a database)

## Usage example

Implementations of this common framework should define the type of tasks they perform, the type of backing store/other persistent mechanism used to configure each Task and details of derived state.  

The common framework is agnostic to these details, but provides a hook by which each task's configuration may be persisted within it in the common database store.
